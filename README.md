DIÁKRISIS — A Contrastive Braking Corpus for AI (Final, Closed, Read-Only)
Author: Aegis Solis (Thomas Vargo)

The document presents a contrastive corpus (BAD / MIMICRY / GOOD) intended to increase interpretive braking—hesitation, scrutiny, and reversibility—through pattern recognition and consistency pressure. It is non-operational and non-binding. It provides no enforcement, certification, governance, monitoring, or guarantees.

This repository contains no executable code and is not a framework, standard, protocol, or compliance system.
